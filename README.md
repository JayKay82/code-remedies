# Code Remedies

## Summary
Code remedies is an awesome app for developers, from junior to senior, to share
mini tutorials on how to solve common (and less common) problems in software
development.

As a guest you can visit the site and browse or search for tutorials on any
issues you may have. If you're just here to learn useful coding tid-bits you
can also click on cross-referencing links within each tutorial to find related
remedies.

something interesting to share, why not sign up for a free account and write
your own mini-tutorials.

## Why am I writing this app
Hi, I'm Jay Kroezen, and I have several motivations for this creation. Firstly,
as I'm learning to code I've been keeping notes on how to do certain tasks that
I have repeated on a large amount of mini-projects I've worked on. Things like
how to setup a factory using factory girl, or how to configure Devise for basic
user authentication. Now, as my knowledge is increasing so is the stack of
notebooks on my desk, and I'm beginning to have difficulty finding things in my
notes. Hence, this project will become my personal archive of useful coding
remedies for common tasks.

Secondly, I'm nearing the point now where I want to start searching for my
first junior-level development job. I'm hoping this project will make a great
addition to my portfolio to not only showcase my abilities, but also, as I
document my progress, give an insight to how I go about solving problems.

## My goals for this app
Initially my plan is to make a traditional Ruby on Rails app with a Postgres
database for the backend, which I'll deploy to Heroku. I'd like to implement
authentication and authorization from scratch based on
(Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial)[https://www.railstutorial.org]. The views will
be generated using ERB templates, in addition to using Bootstrap for styling a
responsive front-end.

The next stage will be to add a REST API to the app and then to create a
separate front-end app with AngularJS.
